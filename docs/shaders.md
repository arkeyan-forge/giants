# Giants' shaders: from the disc, without a runtime dump

> **Purpose:** where Giants' shaders are on the disc, the Alchemy formats that hold them, and how the kit builds the cache · **Status:** current (2026-10-26) · **Tags:** [Alchemy] [Giants]

Goal (done, kit 0.5.0): a player's SkyBuild builds the Giants shader cache from the disc alone, with no `SKY_DUMP_SHADERS` run through the
game. Tool: `tools/shaders/giants_extract.py` (Python standard library only, `python3 -I`). Everything it writes goes
to `private/` (derived from the disc, never committed).

## On the disc

### Where the shaders are [Giants] [V]

**All of them are in one file: `/permanent/global.bld`** (8.7 MB on disc, 13 entries). Its biggest entry, an
IGZ of 42 MB, holds 4394 distinct containers (264 vertex, 4130
pixel). None of the other 890 archives (`.arc` and `.bld`, levels, characters, misc) has any. The earlier note that
"378 raw containers are on the disc" was wrong: those were chance matches of the 4-byte magic.

Not on the disc: 50 containers that Bink 2 builds when it opens a movie (see "Bink" below).

### Format facts [Alchemy] [V] (reverse-engineered from the disc)
The engine's formats, cited by `runtime/host/art/alchemy_archive.*` and `tools/skybuild/igz_shaders.*`.

#### IGA v8 (little-endian), the `.arc` and `.bld` files
```
00 "IGA\x1a"   04 version = 8   08 u32 size of the tables   0C u32 file count n   10 u32 0x100 (data alignment)
1C u32 name table offset        20 u32 name table size      34 u32 hashes[n], then n x { u32 offset, u32 size, u32 flags }
```
- `flags == 0xFFFFFFFF`: the entry is stored as is (`.arc` mostly).
- Otherwise it is **chunked LZMA**, 0x8000 bytes of output per chunk, every chunk at a 0x100-aligned offset:
  `[u16 n][5 bytes LZMA props 5D 00 80 00 00][n bytes of raw LZMA]` (lc=3 lp=0 pb=2, dictionary 0x8000, no end marker, the
  decoder needs ~8 bytes past `n`). A chunk that does not start with those props is **stored** (0x8000 raw bytes, or the
  rest of the file). The archive also has a chunk table after the entries (offsets in 0x100 units, bit 15 or 31 =
  compressed); reading chunks one after the other makes it unnecessary.
- The name table (`u32 offsets[n]`, then NUL-terminated source paths; [art.md](art.md#iga-v8-name-table)) is not needed
  here: shaders are found by content. The reader (IGA, LZMA) is `runtime/host/art/alchemy_archive.cpp`, shared by SkyBuild
  (`tools/skybuild/igz_shaders.cpp`), the game and Skylauncher.

#### IGZ v6 (big-endian), the objects inside
```
00 "IGZ\x01"  04 version = 6   10: sections, 16 bytes each: { u32 file offset, u32 size, u32 alignment, u32 id }, until size 0
```
Section 0 holds the object tables; the other sections are memory pools. Inside section 0, the memory blocks an object owns
are listed as pairs `{ u32 kind<<24 | size, u32 section<<24 | offset }`; `kind` 0x18 is a **physical memory block** (the
microcode). Decode `section` as `sections[section + 1]` and `offset` as relative to that section's file offset.

A shader is two blocks: the **virtual part** (the D3D container header, starts with `102A1100` pixel or `102A1101`
vertex, then virtual size, physical size) and the **physical part** (constants and microcode) a few bytes after it. The
gap is 0 to 28 bytes (16-byte alignment in memory plus an optional 16-byte block), so it can't be guessed: the physical
block comes from the pair whose size equals the container's `physicalSize` and whose offset lies within 0x40 bytes after
the virtual part.

What the game passes to `D3DVertexShader_Init` / `D3DPixelShader_Init` and what `d3d/shaders.cpp` hashes is
`virtual part + physical part`, concatenated. The extractor writes exactly that, so XenosRecomp's hash (XXH3-64 of the
file) is the run-time hash.

## How we extract it

### The extractor (Python, for developers)

```
python3 -I tools/shaders/giants_extract.py <giants.iso> private/giants/shaders/disc [<runtime dump dir>]
```
It lists the disc (XDVDFS), opens each `.arc`/`.bld`, decodes every entry that starts with `IGZ\x01`, finds containers
(magic, sane sizes, block table match) and writes `<sha1 prefix>.vs|.ps` plus `manifest.txt`. With a dump dir it compares
by content and writes `missing.txt`. **48 s** on an M1 Pro for the 891 archives (4 processes, `JOBS=` to change).

### Coverage

Against the 4444 containers of the run-time dumps (several runs, to the title screen and past):

| | |
|---|---|
| found on the disc by the extractor | **4394** (264 vertex, 4130 pixel), all of them byte-identical to a dumped container |
| in the dumps but not on the disc | **50** (Bink 2) |
| on the disc but never dumped | 0 |

So static extraction is **complete for everything the engine loads from data (98.9 %)**. Nothing in the dumps came from a
level archive: the global archive is the only source, and it is loaded at boot.

### Bink 2's 50 run-time shaders [Giants]
Bink 2 builds its movie shaders in code: the 0x20-byte-aligned microcode is in `default.xex` (all 50 physical parts are
found whole in the loaded image), but the virtual part is a D3D header assembled at run time from a compiled-in Microsoft
shader blob (its fields are patched: sizes, offsets, the constant table). That part is not a byte string of the image.
**Done: the short run** (as for SSA's Bink shaders): after SkyBuild builds the game, it runs it headless with
`SKY_DUMP_SHADERS=<dir>` until the first Bink logo opens (9 s), rebuilds the cache with the 50 and relinks
([history.md](history.md), "Installing Giants"). Not done: shipping the 50 as a recipe (it needs Bink's assembler, the
`BinkOpen` path, understood).

**The picture was black on Windows (found 2026-11-01, by the tester's report) [V]:** the pass ended 8 s after the first new shader, and Giants' first ones come with the title, 17 s before the logo's under Wine. The Windows kit's own SkyBuild, run under Wine, found 45 of the 50 and finished without an error. The 5 missing draw the final passes: that game shows a black picture with silhouettes and the button hints. `movie_shaders=50` in `game.txt` makes the pass wait for all of them, and `MoviePassDone` makes an update repair a short pass. Not seen on the Mac: there the logo starts within the 8 s.

### What SkyBuild does for Giants (C++, `tools/skybuild/igz_shaders.cpp`, no Python)
1. Extract the XEX and translate the code (XenonRecomp), as for SSA.
2. Read `/permanent/global.bld` (`shaders=igz:/permanent/global.bld` in `games/giants/game.txt`): 4394 containers, the
   same as `giants_extract.py`, in under a second (the Python tool takes 48 s for the whole disc, 2 s for that file).
3. XenosRecomp on that folder: 4394 shaders, the same time as before (15 min on an M1 Pro, measured: 2319 s CPU; the translation, not
   the extraction, dominates).
4. Compile the runtime with the cache, then the short run for the 50 Bink shaders (above), the cache again and the link.

## Tests
2026-10-25:
Cache from the extractor's 4394 files only (XenosRecomp, no runtime dump, `[gpu] shader cache: 4394 shaders`), game
built in `build-giants`, offscreen isolated boot of 75 s with `SKY_SKIP_MOVIES=1`: reaches the title scene at 60 fps, 58
draws per frame. Shaders missing at draw time: **10 distinct, all pixel shaders and all among the 50 Bink ones**;
none from the engine's own data. Since kit 0.5.0 the 50 are in the cache too: `[gpu] shader cache: 4443 shaders` (4394 +
50 - 1 duplicate), the title scene at 60 fps ([history.md](history.md), "Installing Giants").

2026-10-27 (SSA polish, a 1-hour soak with the cache of the kit): the run logs one more missing pixel shader, **`95CAD664E1351A05`**, which
is **not among the 4394 of `global.bld`** (all 4394 translate: 0 skipped) and not in the cache's 50: a run-time container (with the
dump of a run at `SKY_DUMP_SHADERS`, 48 containers are not on the disc list). XenosRecomp rejects it: 3 `tfetch2D` and one `tfetch1D`, and the
translator has no 1D texture (`TEXTURE_DIMENSIONS` is 2D, 3D, cube). Supporting it takes both sides: the translator (a 1D fetch as a 2D one at
v = 0.5) and the runtime (guest 1D textures: `TextureForUntimed` returns no texture for dimension 0). Open; no visible effect was noted in the
runs (the draw is a rect list seen once, at boot).

**Fixed (2026-10-27) [V].** The translator now emits a `tfetch1D` as a fetch of a **2D texture of one row** at v = 0.5
(`patches/xenosrecomp.patch`: dimension "2D", `float2(u, 0.5)`, the offset on u only), and the runtime binds a guest 1D
texture like a 2D one (`TextureFor`, `d3d/render.cpp`: only 3D textures are refused now; the fetch constant's height is 1).
The cache has `95CAD664E1351A05` (4443 shaders + it), the pipeline is built at draw time (0.2 ms) and the draw is no longer skipped.
**Where it is used:** `SKY_LOG_SHADER=95CAD664E1351A05` says once where a pixel shader is first drawn: here at frame 921 of a
run from the title, as the tutorial's first scene appears (Eon's intro, offscreen shots show the painted scene and the dialogue
box, nothing visibly wrong), primitive 6 (a strip), vertex shader `51AA1C15D50798F3`, into a 2000x1200 target (the scene or a
full-screen pass, scale 2). Seen once; its look cannot be compared with a console, so "draws" is [V], "draws right" is [?].
The same change is available to SSA's translator for any 1D fetch (none known). **Not in a player's kit yet:** the install's short
headless run (the Bink 2 shaders) never reaches that scene, so the kit's cache lacks it and a player's game still skips that one
draw; adding the tutorial's first seconds to the install run (or this shader's container to the kit) is the next step [?].

## Is it engine-generic?
Swap Force and the later Alchemy games:
Probably the method, not the bytes:
- The **IGA** container changes (Swap Force v10 big-endian, Trap Team and later v11): header offsets, entry size and the
  compression (zlib/LZMA, chunk size) must be redone, but the entries are still plain IGZ files.
- The **IGZ** layout changes (v7, v8 big-endian, v9) but keeps the idea: shader objects own a virtual block and a physical
  block listed in an object table. The scan for `102A110x` + the physical-size match is version-independent as long as
  a table of `(size, offset)` pairs exists; the table's tag and the section-index convention have to be re-derived.
- Fallback when a game's layout is not understood: the XEX-hook run dump, as for Giants before this work.
Swap Force (2026-10-27) confirmed it: one archive (`shaders_xenon.pak`), the same container scan; v7 lists the physical
blocks in a tagged `TMHN` record, away from the virtual parts, paired in order ([its shaders.md](https://github.com/arkeyan-forge/swap-force/blob/main/docs/shaders.md)).
